Handwritten notes are still an important process for note-taking. Moving into the 21\subscript{st} century, users are becoming more connected with technology. \textit{MapMyNotes} aims to build the bridge between of handwritten notes and saving it to existing services.

\textit{MapMyNotes} can be considered as three distinct sections: image pre-processing, handwriting recognition and an accompany web application. Integrating with an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool it aims to suggest metadata from the note which aids a user in tagging their notes. The note is then connected to distributed services and stored in a calendar event.

The paper explores the analysis, design, implementation and testing of the project and clearly describes the rationale for design and implementations.
