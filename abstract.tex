Handwritten notes are still an important aspect of note-taking. Moving into the 21\textsuperscript{st} century, users are becoming more connected with Internet services. \textit{MapMyNotes} aims to build the bridge between handwritten notes and Internet-connected services (e.g Google Calendar events).

\textit{MapMyNotes} can be considered as three distinct sections: image pre-processing, handwriting recognition and an accompanying web application. Integrating with an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool, it aims to suggest metadata from the note, which aids in tagging a note. The application also integrates with the user's calendar to archive the notes.

The paper explores a variety of issues through the analysis, design, implementation and testing stages, giving justification on key design and implementation decisions. Results are presented to show the OCR's performance over a series of training examples. There are insights and thoughts concluding where the note-taking tool could then be taken further.
