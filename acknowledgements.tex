I'd like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Hannah Dee for the support received throughout the project especially with the Computer Vision sides. I'd also like to thank Dr. Harry Strange for initially suggesting the project.

I am grateful to all my friends and family for their support throughout my degree. Special acknowledgments go to Laura, who has stood beside me throughout my degree. An honorable mention goes to Katie who helped in proof reading the report before submission.
