I'd like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Hannah Dee for the support received during the project especially facilitating as the customer throughout the process and the advice and direction given in improving technical and non-technical skills. I'd also like to thank Dr. Harry Strange for suggesting the initial project title.

I am grateful to all my friends and family for their support throughout my degree. Special acknowledgments go to Laura, who has stood beside me throughout my degree. An honorable mention goes to Katie who helped in proof reading the report before submission.
