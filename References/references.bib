    abstract = {{This is an investigation into the possible links between psychomotor action, in the activities of handwriting, and memory. A comparison of recall and recognition for common words demonstrates that memory is better for words when they have been written down rather than when they are typed. This provides additional support for the hypothesis that the additional context provided by the complex task of writing results in better memory. With the recent trend towards electronic note taking, the educational and practical implications of these findings would suggest that performance may be improved by using traditional paper-and-pen notes.}},

    abstract = {{Human cognition involves many mental processes that are highly interrelated, such as perception, attention, memory, and thinking. An important and core cognitive process is memory, which is commonly associated with the storing and remembering of environmental information. An interesting issue in memory research is on ways to enhance memory performance, and thus, remembering of information. Can colour result in improved memory abilities? The present paper highlights the relationship between colours, attention, and memory performance. The significance of colour in different settings is presented first, followed by a description on the nature of human memory. The role of attention and emotional arousal on memory performance is discussed next. The review of several studies on colours and memory are meant to explain some empirical works done in the area and related issues that arise from such studies.}},

@article{Olurinola_Tayo_2015, title={Colour in Learning: Its Effect on the Retention Rate of Graduate Students}, volume={6}, ISSN={2222-1735}, abstractNote={Cognitive psychologists have discovered different design principles to enhance memory performance. It has been said that retrieving process depends on many variables and one of them is colour. This paper provides an overview of research on colour and learning. It includes the effect of colour on attention, retention and memory performance, and relates these to the design of instructional materials. The study reported the effect colour had on the retention rate of graduate students of the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye. Thirty graduate students participated in this study. The purpose of this research study was to determine if colour (in prints form) influence the learning process. The independent variable was colour at two levels: Congruent colours (colours corresponding to the words) and Incongruent colours (colours not related to the words), while for the control, Achromatic colours (black and shades of grey) were used. The dependent variable was the retention rate i.e. number of words recalled. The research design was a posttest only design. A one-way ANOVA was used to analyze the data and the results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference in the number of words recalled based on colour. The groups exposed to congruent colours and achromatic colours performed better than those exposed to incongruent colours, although the group exposed to the congruent colour prints performed better than those of the other groups. Therefore designers of instructional materials need to use colour wisely by paying attention to the effect of colour on learning.}, number={14}, journal={Journal of Education and Practice}, author={Olurinola, Oluwakemi and Tayo, Omoniyi}, year={2015}, pages={1–5}, annote={Discusses a study which shows that coloured text is better for the memory retention rates, than that of non-coloured text.

A commonly used thresholding technique, the Otsu method, provides satisfactory results for thresholding an image with a histogram of bimodal distribution. This method, however, fails if the histogram is unimodal or close to unimodal. For defect detection applications, defects can range from no defect to small or large defects, which means that the gray-level distributions range from unimodal to bimodal. For this paper, we revised the Otsu method for selecting optimal threshold values for both unimodal and bimodal distributions, and tested the performance of the revised method, the valley-emphasis method, on common defect detection applications.}},

In this paper, we compare an existing (Otsu), modified existing (Kittler-Illingworth) and simple peak-based thresholding approach on a set of 982 documents for which existing ground truth (full text) is available. We use the output of an open source OCR engine which incorporates an adaptive/dynamic thresholder that can be bypassed by one of the three global thresholds we tested. This allowed comparison of these three approaches in the aggregate. We then used an independently-generated dictionary as a means of characterizing thresholder efficacy. Such an approach, if successful, will provide the means for selecting an optimal thresholder in the absence of a large set of ground truthed documents. Our preliminary findings here indicate that this approach may provide a reliable means for thresholder comparison and eventually preclude the need for time-intensive human ground truthing.}},
