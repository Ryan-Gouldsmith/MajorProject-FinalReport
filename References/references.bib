@article{citeulike:13988059,
    abstract = {{This is an investigation into the possible links between psychomotor action, in the activities of handwriting, and memory. A comparison of recall and recognition for common words demonstrates that memory is better for words when they have been written down rather than when they are typed. This provides additional support for the hypothesis that the additional context provided by the complex task of writing results in better memory. With the recent trend towards electronic note taking, the educational and practical implications of these findings would suggest that performance may be improved by using traditional paper-and-pen notes.}},
