\textbf{Please provide a brief summary of your project (150 word max)}

With the human study I will be using handwriting for the application to read and analyse. Additionally I will be creating a web application so human interaction to ensure that the website provides good user experience would be needed, Therefore, I would need participants to analyse and give their own opinions on the application. Finally, some statistical measuring of a user's handwriting data will be conducted.
